# Fintech-Security-Foundations
Architecting a 'Security as a Growth Engine' framework for high-stakes financial platforms. This repository contains the governance standards designed to protect digital assets while enabling rapid organizational scale.

**1. Zero-Trust Access & Identity (IdP) Standard**
- Hardware-Based Mandate: All administrative and financial-access accounts must utilize Hardware-Based Authentication (YubiKeys) to eliminate the risk of phishing and session hijacking.

- Least-Privilege Enforcement: Identity Providers (IdP) like Microsoft Entra or JumpCloud must be configured with Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to ensure just-in-time access rather than permanent admin rights.

- Vault Auditing: Weekly automated audits of 1Password vault permissions to ensure no permission drift occurs during rapid hiring cycles.

**2. JML (Joiner-Mover-Leaver) Automation Protocol**
- Zero-Touch Onboarding: Automated provisioning of core SaaS tools via SCIM/SAML to ensure new hires are productive on Day 1 without manual IT intervention.

- Instant Offboarding: A single-click revocation policy that triggers across all IdP-connected apps, including remote-wipe of hardware, to secure data within minutes of a departure.

- Security Gap Mitigation: Eliminates orphan accounts that are common targets for malicious actors in fast-paced environments.

**3. Device Lifecycle & Global MDM Compliance**
- 100% Enrollment Policy: No device can access corporate data (Slack, GitHub, Email) without active MDM enrollment (Intune/JumpCloud).

- Automated Hardening: Devices must automatically enforce FileVault/BitLocker encryption, firewall configurations, and OS patch compliance.

- Remote-Ready Infrastructure: Scalable inventory tracking and return-logistics for a distributed global workforce.

**4. Crypto-Fintech Incident Response Framework**
- Identity Breach Protocol: Specialized Rapid Reaction steps for suspected credential theft, including immediate hardware-key rotation and forensic audit trail generation.

- Continuous Monitoring: Leveraging Microsoft Sentinel to detect anomalous logins or unauthorized data egress from cloud vaults.

**5. Audit-Readiness & People Empowerment**
- SOC 2/ISO Alignment: Leveraging Microsoft Purview for automated compliance logging, reducing the future audit preparation workload by 20%.

- Frictionless Security: By automating MFA and access, we remove security friction, allowing engineers and builders to move faster while remaining protected.

- Empowered Workforce: Security is no longer a bottleneck; it is a transparent safety net.
